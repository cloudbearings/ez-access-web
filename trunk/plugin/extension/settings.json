/* Feel free to change, add and remove elements, but MAKE SURE it is valid JSON. 
   Common mistakes:
    1. Not including comma after every element (except for last, or first if only one)
    2. Including a comma on last element.
   Use http://jsonlint.com/ to validate WITHOUT the "var foo = " part.
