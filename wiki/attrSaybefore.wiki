#summary Details about the data-ez-saybefore attribute and variants.

{{{
<button data-ez-saybefore="Volume" onclick="volumeUp()">Up</button>
}}}

= Description =
Specifies what the speech output should say before the speech output specific to a given element. There are three variants:

  * `data-ez-saybefore`
    * Preferred. It specifies the prepended speech output in all modes unless overridden by a more specific modal attribute below.
  * `data-ez-sayalt-nav`
    * Specifies the prepended speech output for the EZ Navigation mode, where users press EZ Up or Down to get to an element. This overrides the general `data-ez-saybefore` attribute for the EZ Navigation mode only.
  * `data-ez-sayalt-point`
    * Specifies the prepended speech output for the EZ Pointing modes, like Slide-to-read and Button Help, where users point to elements to have them read. This overrides the general `data-ez-saybefore` attribute for the EZ Pointing mode only.

  * Applies to: all content elements except `<body>`
  * Inheritable: no
  * Supported since: 1.0.0

== Values ==
  * `data-ez-saybefore="`_`string`_`"`
    * _string_ is the string to be spoken before that (prepended) of the speech output for the given element.

== Behavior with missing attribute ==
The speech output is the default for that type of element with nothing prepended.

== Best practices ==
The `data-ez-saybefore` is useful when you need to prepend some additional speech to make something clearer. This is particularly useful for data displayed in tabular or list format.
