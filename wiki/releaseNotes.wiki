  * Speech output through Chrome using the operating system API and voices
  * Customizable navigation highlight
  * Slide-to-read
  * Customizable help

=== Limitations ===
This version works properly with systems that use touchscreen through dedicated touchscreen drivers and input methods. Touchscreens that implement mouse-type input will not behave the same and transition properly between EZ Access and touchscreen modes, but will be usable.
  * At this point, touch screen input is best supported in Windows 7 and 8. 

=== Elements completely supported ===
The following interactive elements are completely supported by v. 1.0.
  * Buttons
    * `<input type="button"`, `"submit"`, or `"reset"` `/>`
    * `<button>` of all types
    * Elements with `aria-role="button"`
  * Checkboxes
    * `<input type="checkbox" />`
    * Elements with `aria-role="checkbox"`
  * Radio buttons
    * `<input type="radio" />`
    * Elements with `aria-role="radio"`
  * Hyperlinks
    * `<a href="`...`">`
    * Elements with `aria-role="link"`
  * Clickable elements with `onclick` attribute

Other interactive elements are navigable and will be read to the user, but may not behave as expected in this version.
