#summary Details about the <body data-ez-reset> attribute.

{{{
<body data-ez data-ez-reset>
}}}

= Description =
The `data-ez-reset` attribute signals to the EZ Access extension that session variables should be reset. This resets:
  * The EZ Back button so that it does not go back using the browser's history. (v 1.0)
  * The system volume to the default level. (v 1.0)

  * Applies to: `<body>` only
  * Inheritable: no
  * Supported since: 1.0.0

== Values ==
The `data-ez-reset` attribute takes no values. If using an XML variant, you may use `data-ez-reset="data-ez-reset"`.

== Best Practices ==
  * This attribute should be included on the first page of an application. 
  * It may alternately be included on a reset page, which then redirects automatically to the first page of the application.
  * Consider also including the [attrStart `data-ez-start="off"`] attribute when using the `data-ez-reset` attribute.
