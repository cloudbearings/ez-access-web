= Introduction =

EZ Access has a debug mode that allows developers to troubleshoot EZ Access parsing of their HTML pages to determine what is going wrong.

= How to enable =

To enable, go to Tools-->Extensions-->EZ Access Browser-->Options, and check the checkbox 'Enable Debug Mode'.

When on your EZ Access enabled page, open the developer tools (F11) and click the tab 'console'.

= Information in Debug Mode =

Many different things are displayed in debug mode, including:

  * Warnings (errors [breaking & non-breaking] are always displayed; debug mode or not)
  * The current array of selected nodes
  * The speech output when spoke in text

Additionally, when each page is loaded, information on setup is displayed (such as EZ Help dependencies).
