= Introduction =

As EZ Access is pretty stable at the moment, there are a few things that I'd like to finish before calling it a day and releasing the first production build. This list outlines the TODO from r205 on 8/3/13.

I think there are many things left to do, but I would like to avoid feature creep, and many things are not critical to operation and can be left to a further release.

= TODO =

== Need to do ==

  * Complete EZ Enter function with proper checkmarking and interacting with certain elements.
  * Any open MEDIUM priority or higher issue reports.
  * TODO tags in code
  * Code warning cleanup
  * Comprehensive testing

== Need/want to do ==

  * Complete EZ Help dialogue works.

== Want to do ==

  * Complete international language support.
  * Wrapping checkboxes/etc with respective label -- WANT, otherwise simply make label not navigable (NEED).
  * Complete developer/implementer debugging mode, and possibly a page validation checker (?).
