#summary Details about the <body data-ez> attribute.

{{{
<body data-ez>
}}}

= Description =
The `data-ez` attribute signals to the EZ Access extension that the page purports to be EZ Access-compatible and that the EZ Access extension should load when the paged does.

In its default configuration, the EZ Access extension will not operate on pages that do not have the `data-ez` attribute.

  * Applies to: `<body>` only
  * Inheritable: no
  * Supported since: 1.0.0

== Values ==
The `data-ez` attribute takes no values. If using an XML variant, you may use `data-ez="data-ez"`.

== Best Practices ==
  * This attribute should be included on every page of the application.
